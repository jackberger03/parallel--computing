# Project Context: CSCE 435 HW1

This document describes the key files and their roles in the CSCE 435 Homework 1 project on parallel programming.

## Core C Programs (Provided by TA/Instructor)

*   `compute_pi.c`:
    *   Computes an estimate of PI using a parallel algorithm with Pthreads (shared-memory).
    *   Input: number of points (`n`), number of threads (`p`).
    *   Output: Trials, Threads, pi estimate, error, time (sec).
*   `compute_pi_mpi.c`:
    *   Computes an estimate of PI using a parallel algorithm with MPI (distributed-memory).
    *   Input: number of intervals (`n`). Number of processes (`p`) is passed via `mpirun`.
    *   Output: n, p, pi estimate, relative error, time (sec).

## SLURM Job Scripts (Provided by TA/Instructor, or generated)

*   `compute_pi.grace_job` (Example provided in HW description):
    *   A sample SLURM batch script to run `compute_pi.exe` in dedicated mode on Grace.
    *   Illustrates how to set SBATCH directives for nodes, tasks, memory, time, etc.
*   `compute_pi_mpi.grace_job` (Example provided in HW description):
    *   A sample SLURM batch script to run `compute_pi_mpi.exe`.

## Helper & Automation Scripts

*   `calculate.sh`:
    *   **Purpose:** Generates all necessary SLURM job scripts for the experiments required in Part 1 and Part 2 of the homework.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Creates directories: `job_scripts/`, `results_part1/`, `results_part2/`.
        *   Generates individual `.slurm` files in `job_scripts/` for each experimental run, configured with appropriate `n`, `p`, `ntasks-per-node`, and SLURM directives.
        *   Creates `run_all_jobs.sh` to easily submit all generated SLURM jobs.
    *   **Location:** Project root.
*   `run_all_jobs.sh` (Generated by `calculate.sh`):
    *   **Purpose:** A simple bash script containing `sbatch` commands to submit all individual job scripts generated by `calculate.sh`.
    *   **Location:** Project root.

## Data & Analysis Files

*   `job_output.txt`:
    *   **Purpose:** A consolidated file where the user has pasted the standard output from the execution of (at least) the Part 1 SLURM jobs run on Grace.
    *   **Content:** Contains lines like "Trials = ..., Threads = ..., pi = ..., error = ..., time (sec) = ...".
    *   **Used by:** `main.py` for parsing experimental results.
    *   **Location:** Project root.
*   `main.py`:
    *   **Purpose:** A Python script to parse `job_output.txt`, perform data analysis, generate plots, and print answers for the homework questions (currently focused on Part 1).
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Parses experimental data (trials, threads, pi, error, time).
        *   Calculates speedup and efficiency.
        *   Identifies optimal parameters (e.g., `p` for minimum runtime).
        *   Generates plots using `matplotlib` (e.g., time vs. p, speedup vs. p, error vs. n).
        *   Outputs textual answers to homework questions.
        *   Saves a summary table to `performance_summary.csv`.
    *   **Dependencies:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy` (managed by `uv`).
    *   **Location:** Project root.
*   `performance_summary.csv` (Generated by `main.py`):
    *   **Purpose:** Stores a summary table of key performance metrics (e.g., optimal `p`, min time, max speedup/efficiency) for different problem sizes.
    *   **Location:** Project root.
*   `*.png` (e.g., `experiment_1_analysis.png`, `error_vs_problem_size.png` - Generated by `main.py`):
    *   **Purpose:** Image files containing the plots required by the homework assignment.
    *   **Location:** Project root.

## Documentation Files (`docs/` directory)

*   `ProjectPlan.md`: Overview of the homework assignment requirements.
*   `ai_plan.md`: AI's plan for assisting with the project.
*   `past.md`: Record of completed tasks and milestones.
*   `future.md`: Outline of upcoming tasks and next steps.
*   `context.md`: This file; describes the purpose of major files in the project.
